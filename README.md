In this internship project, I was assigned to develop a multithreaded client-server chat application using Java. The task involved creating a server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously, allowing them to communicate in real-time. I implemented the system using Java Sockets and multithreading concepts to ensure smooth message transmission and reception between users. For coding, I preferred using IntelliJ IDEA as it provided an efficient and user-friendly interface. This project can be applied in real-world scenarios such as online support systems, collaborative tools, or any platform where real-time group communication is needed through a local or remote server.
